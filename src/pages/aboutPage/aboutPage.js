				<h1 class="dark-text" align="center">About Us</h1>
				<p class="dark-text" align="left">Theta Tau is a co-ed professional engineering fraternity. The purpose of Theta Tau is to develop and maintain a high standard of professional interest among its members, and to unite them in a strong bond of fraternal fellowship. Nationally, our fraternity was founded at the University of Minnesota on October 15, 1904.  Since then, we have grown to over sixty active chapters nationwide with ten active colonies.  We are the oldest and largests engineering fraternity in the country, having initiated over 30,000 members since 1904.  Our alumni have gone on to be business owners, astronauts, US Senators, and very successful engineers.</p>

				<p class="dark-text" align="left">Our chapter was founded by a few men living on the fifth floor of Rhoads Hall in the fall of 1997.  They sought out engineering fraternities and found Theta Tau, and they soon contacted the national officers about forming a chapter of Theta Tau at VCU.  They formed Xi Omega Chi, a local engineering fraternity, which became the VCU Colony of Theta Tau on March 28, 1998.  Because The VCU School of Engineering was not ABET accredited at the time, we were required to be a colony for two years, and on September 9, 2000, the Kappa Gamma chapter of Theta Tau was installed with 24 men and women as charter members.  Since our beginning, we have had 215 sign our chapter roll and join us as brothers.</p>

				<p class="dark-text" align="left">We organize a speaker series every semester, where we have professors and other prominent engineers come talk about their research, careers, etc.  We have also gone on numerous plant tours as part of our professional development.  We also volunteer at numerous places including the Children's Museum of Richmond, the Virginia FIRST Regional robotics competition, Relay for Life, and others.  We also host &Theta;&Tau; Tuesdays, where we sell pizza in the West Engineering Building for a very good price for broke college students.  Every other Thursday, we run coffee/bagel hour, where we provide coffee, bagels, and doughnuts to the engineering school in the West Hall lobby free of charge.  Quite often, the engineering school brings in a company to talk about job and internship offers for engineering students, making these events very beneficial to engineering students.</p>

				<p class="dark-text" align="left">All of this and more that we do allowed us to receive the honor of the Schrader Award, given to the top chapter in the nation every two years, at the July 2012 National Convention in Boston.</p>

				<p class="dark-text" align="left">Since our beginnings, our numbers have grown from a small group of eleven men to a chapter of 40.  Our presence on campus has grown dramatically since our beginnings in 1997, and we have made a great impact on both our engineering school and the overall university.</p>
